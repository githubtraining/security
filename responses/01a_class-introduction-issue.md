## :tada: Welcome to Securing your workflows!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a secure repository in GitHub.  A secure repository is important for many reasons.
- Prevents exposing sensitive data
- Enforces secure development best practices
- Guards against unintended access rights permissions

In this course you will learn how to:

- Opt-in to vulnerability alerts for private repositories
  - _Note: These security settings are default for public repositories that are not forks._
- Detect and fix vulnerable dependencies when notified by a vulnerability alert
- Follow security best practices to protect sensitive data by using a `.gitignore` file

### New to GitHub?
